# Roll-a-Ball
A rolling ball game I made for an assignment of my University VR course. The game was made with Unity 2017.1.1f1.

### Game Rule
Roll your pokeball to catch(collide with) pokemons(cubes). Meanwhile the pokemons would dodge and attack you. 
When you have catched all the pokemons, you win. However, before that if your health goes down to zero or you fall off the island, you lose.

### Operation
Use ARROW keys to roll the pokeball, and use SPACE key to jump.

### Game Trick
One trick to win is to jump often while moving.
